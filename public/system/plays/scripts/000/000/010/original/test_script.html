DELIO. I knew this fellow seven years in the galleys 
For a notorious murder; and 'twas thought 
The cardinal suborn'd it: he was releas'd 
By the French general. 

ANTONIO. Tis great pity
He should be thus neglected: I have heard 
He's very valiant. This foul melancholy 
Will poison all his goodness. 

DELIO. The presence 'gins to fill: you promis'd me 
To make me the partaker of the natures
Of some of your great courtiers. 

ANTONIO. The lord cardinal's 
And other strangers' that are now in court? 
I shall. Here comes the great Calabrian duke. 



FERDINAND. Who took the ring oftenest? 

SILVIO. Antonio Bologna, my lord.
